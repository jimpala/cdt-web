<h1>UCL's Centre for Doctoral Training in Data Intensive Science</h1>
<p>
UCL was selected, after a highly competitive process, to host STFC's first <a 
href="http://www.stfc.ac.uk/news/stfc-invests-in-data-science-experts/">Centre for Doctoral Training (CDT)</a> in data intensive science 
(DIS). DIS encompasses a wide range of areas in the field of 'big-data' including the collection, storage and analysis of large datasets, 
as well as the use of complex models, algorithms and machine learning techniques to interpret the data. The Centre will primarily 
carry out research in 
STFC's flagship Data Intensive Science projects, in High Energy Physics and Astronomy, which have been at the forefront of DIS research 
for several decades and provide the ideal training ground for DIS.
</p>
<p>
Over 80 academics from across UCL will be involved in the Centre. This 
includes academics from the <a href="https://www.hep.ucl.ac.uk/">High Energy Physics</a>, 
<a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/star/">Astrophysics</a> and the <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/phys/amopp">Atomic and Molecular Physics</a> 
groups in the <a href="http://www.phys.ucl.ac.uk/">Department of Physics & Astronomy</a>, as well as academics from the 
departments of <a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/mssl">Space and Climate Physics</a>, 
<a href="http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/home/">Computer Science</a>, <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/Mathematics/">Mathematics</a>, <a 
href="https://www.ee.ucl.ac.uk/">Electrical Engineering</a> and <a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics">Statistical Science</a>. The 
CDT's vision is to provide a unique studentship experience, that will produce highly trained and employable PhD graduates with advanced 
and 
widely applicable skills in DIS, who will ultimately become the future leaders of this field in both academia and industry. 
In addition, by bringing together DIS experts from a range of sectors and fields, it will promote the development of new DIS techniques or 
the application of existing techniques to new areas, which will have a wide and significant impact on all sectors.
</p>
<p>
The Centre launched in September 2017 and is <a href="https://www.hep.ucl.ac.uk/cdt-dis/studentships.shtml">now hiring</a> for its 2nd cohort, who will start their PhDs in September 2018.

<figcaption class="lefttext">A candidate Higgs Event from the ATLAS detector. There are over 100 million collisions in the ATLAS detector per second, but only a tiny fraction of the collisions will create a Higgs boson. Quickly and effectively analysing these huge datasets for a tiny signal has resulted in the ATLAS experiment being at the forefront of developments in data intensive science. </figcaption>
